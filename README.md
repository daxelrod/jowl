Jowl - JSON Operations With Lodash
-

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/daxelrod/jowl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/daxelrod/jowl)

Jowl is a command-line filter for JSON expressions that uses plain JavaScript
with [Lodash](https://lodash.com/). It takes JSON on standard in, and writes
pretty-printed JSON to standard out.

Why not JQ?

[JQ](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) is an awesome program that does this way
better than Jowl. Unfortunately, it uses its own syntax that I can never
remember. On the other hand, I use Lodash every day.
